        <h2>About Providential Mathematics Olympiads</h2>
        <p>Mathematics is the pinnacle of all natural sciences, something which is more often used than not in all fields of scientific research. It is a subject derived directly from pure logic, a direct reflection of common sense in its simplest form, something simple yet abstract, near-perfect yet sophisticated. The value of learning mathematics is much greater than being able to solve math problems or becoming a mathematician; it is learning a new way to think, a new approach to life, one which we may find beneficial only after experiencing it ourselves.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>The Providential Mathematics Olympiads are a series of olympiad-level contests in mathematics. The main focus of the olympiads are not on breadth of mathematical knowledge and techniques, but instead focused on a competitor's ability to think creatively to solve difficult problems under an intense environment. Competitors will find that all of the problems can be solved easily using techniques and principles introduced in secondary school, however it is difficult to devise those solutions by themselves.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although olympiad-style examinations are usually used to select top performing students for national teams and competition in international competitions, the intensity and problem-solving nature of math olympiads makes it especially effective in cultivating math and problem-solving skills in all young mathematicians. We believe that if used correctly, math olympiads can be used as valuable learning tools to develop much more than math skills.</p>

Participants should have a decent amount of experience with problem solving and proof-writing. The format of the competition is different from traditional olympiads.</td>

              <td>Also known as the Providential Mathematics Quarterly, this is a competition for students who are just being introduced to formal proofwriting and have a strong acquisition of middle school mathematics and algebra up to algebra 2. The problems are challenging but solvable for experienced students, and are designed to be easily approachable for all students. Most of the problems are much more interesting than typical exam questions, and are closer to math puzzles/games.</td>
